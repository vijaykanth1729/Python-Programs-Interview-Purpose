Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to
generate and then generates them.
The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers
where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,
two numbers in the sequence.
The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦
